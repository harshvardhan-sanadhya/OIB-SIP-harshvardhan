# Data Science Internship Projects â€“ Oasis Infobyte

This folder contains the Data Science projects I completed during my internship with Oasis Infobyte.  
These projects helped me strengthen my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using Python and popular data science libraries.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Advertisement Sales Prediction  
Built a regression model to predict sales based on advertising spending across TV, radio, and newspaper channels.  
Used libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for analysis and model building.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Car Price Prediction  
Developed a machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars using features like car age, kilometers driven, fuel type, and transmission.  
Applied regression algorithms and performed data cleaning, encoding, and feature selection.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Iris Flower Classification  
Implemented a classification model to identify iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on petal and sepal dimensions.  
Visualized the dataset and evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
