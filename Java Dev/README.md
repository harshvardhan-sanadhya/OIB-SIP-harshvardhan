# Java Internship Projects - Oasis Infobyte
This folder contains the java projects I developed during my internship with Oasis Infobyte.

These projects helped me improve my understanding of object-oriented programing, logic building and java syntax.

# Task 1: ATM Interface

A console-based simulation of an ATM system that allows users to perform basic banking operations - like deposit, balance check, and transaction history. It uses classes and methods to handle user interaction and account opearions securely.

# Task 2: Number Guessing Game

A simple Java program where the computer randomly generates a number , and the user has to guess it within limited attempts. the program gives hints like "Guess Higher" , "Guess Lower" to guide the user.
